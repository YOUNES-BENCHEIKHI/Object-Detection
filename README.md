# Object Detection and Video Processing
This project demonstrates various techniques and methods for video processing and object detection using Python.  
The functionalities include:

- Creating a video from a sequence of images  
- Object detection in videos  
- Object detection in static images  
- Downloading videos and verifying their accessibility  
- Real-time object detection using a webcam  

## Features
- Utilizes advanced computer vision libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)  
- Supports real-time processing with webcams  
- Provides tools for video generation from images  

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.7  
- Required libraries: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `math`, etc.
